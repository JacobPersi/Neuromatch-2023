# fMRI Emotion Task Decoding

This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on decoding fMRI data from the paper "Function in the human connectome: task-fMRI and individual differences in behavior" (Barch et al., 2013). The goal of this project is to develop a classifier to predict the experimental condition of the emotion task using whole brain fMRI data.
